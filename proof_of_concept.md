4. **Environment Setup:**
   [ ] Set up development environments for back-end and front-end.
   [ ] Install necessary dependencies and libraries.
   [ ] Configure version control (e.g., Git).

5. **Model (M):**
   [ ] Define data models representing entities in the application.
   [ ] Implement database schema and relationships.
   [ ] Set up ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) for data manipulation.

6. **View (V):**
   [ ] Design user interface mockups or wireframes.
   [ ] Implement HTML templates for different pages/views.
   [ ] Apply CSS for styling and layout.
   [ ] Integrate JavaScript for interactivity and dynamic content.
